# Podcastr

This is a podcast application project built at the NLW # 05 event using NextJS and Static Site Generation.

The final project is based on the version of the event with some extra features. It has the main functions of a player, such as playing, pausing, skipping the episode, going back, in addition to the option of repetition and random mode.

This idea can be applied to any podcast, this version is about the FalaDev podcast.

You can see a live version of app on [Podcastr](https://podcastr-areasflavio.vercel.app)
